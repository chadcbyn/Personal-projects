# 🌸 Chad’s Project Garden 🌸

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
Here you’ll find my personal projects — each one like a small flower growing in this digital garden.  
Right now, I’ve only planted one seed: my **Heapsort Game**. But more blooms are on the way! 🌱✨

## 🎮 Featured Project

### 🏰 Heapsort Game
A fun, interactive way to learn and practice the **Heapsort algorithm**!  
Instead of just reading code, you *play* with the sorting process.

🔗 [Check out the game here](./Heapsort%20Game.xcodeproj)  
📂 Folder: `Heapsort Game.xcodeProj`

**Highlights:**
- Implements **Heapsort** step by step 🌀
- Gamified approach to sorting 🎲
- Great for both practicing CS fundamentals and having fun 💡
